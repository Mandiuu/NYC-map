 # NYC summons map
 
 This interactive map shows the summons related to alcohol and drugs in 2023 in New York City.
 It starts on January 1 and ends on December 31, and every dot is a summons for someone drinking or having drugs in an illegal place in the city. 

#  What to do next? 
- Make the dots clearer 
- Make the animation move faster
- Add other categories of summons and more years
